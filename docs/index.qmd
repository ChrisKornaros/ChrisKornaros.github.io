This site is the personal portfolio and homepage for Chris Kornaros. I'm a Tulane Graduate and professional Data Engineer. On here, you'll find projects and code samples that I can share publicly, guides for various tools or workflows, journal or blog posts, and any independent research or professional updates (including my resume). 

This website is a work in progress, so things are going to move around and break. Additionally, there is a lot that I have to still add: past guides, projects, etc. Follow me on social media (links above) to stay up to date with what I'm working on. To learn more about my background visit [About](pages/about/about.qmd), for guides on various open source tools visit [Guides](pages/guides/guides.qmd), to see my current and past (public) work visit [Projects](pages/projects/projects.qmd), and to see any blog posts (available on WhiteWind) visit [Blogs](pages/blogs/blogs.qmd).

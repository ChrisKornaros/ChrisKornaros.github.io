This site is the personal portfolio and homepage for Chris Kornaros. I'm a Tulane Graduate and professional Data Engineer. On here, you'll find projects and code samples that I can share publicly, guides for various tools or workflows, journal or blog posts, and any independent research or professional updates (including my resume). 

This website is a work in progress, so things are going to move around and break. Additionally, there is a lot that I have to still add: past guides, projects, etc. Feel free to connect with me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/chriskornaros.bsky.social) to stay up to date with what I'm working on.

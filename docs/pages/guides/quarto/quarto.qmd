## Projects
### Initializing a Project
It's easy to start a project with Quarto from the command line, and there are a few built-in project types to further simplify the startup process. 

```{bash}

```

### Rendering a Projects

## Websites
### Rendering Websites 
I run the following code block from my main project directory. My Quarto project directory is a folder called docs. So, I specify to Quarto that I want to render the entire Quarto project `docs`, but `quarto render`'s context is specific to the *quarto project* directory. Therefore, I need to use the `.` to specify that I want the rendered `.html` files put in the Quarto project folder, and sub folder.
```{bash}
quarto render docs --output-dir .
```

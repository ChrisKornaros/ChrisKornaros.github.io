Landing page for the guides part of the website. This will include the step by step guides and instructions for various tools or workflows that I've used in the past, or that I'm currently learning. Current examples include the `uv` guide, and the `Personal portfolio with Quarto and GitHub pages` guide. Future guides (hopefully) include `DuckDB`, `dbt`, `Postgres`, and more.

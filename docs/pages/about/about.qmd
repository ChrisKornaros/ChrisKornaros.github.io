Thanks for visiting! As you can see, this site is pretty messy. That is because my programming skills lie with data, not web design. I've thrown this together with the help of Quarto documentation, SASS documentation, Bootstrap Documentation, _brand.yml documentation, and of course LLMs. Feel free to report issue as you find them, or suggest improvements because there is a link to the source repo on every page.



## About Me
I'm a 27 year old Data Scientist, Engineer, Analyst, Architect, etc. that has two degrees from Tulane University in New Orleans-- BSM, Marketing and Asian Studies; MS, Business Analytics. During COVID, I did an extra year of school and received a Masters in Data Science. As a result of my education, I fell in love with data science and machine learning, but due to common data challenges, I developed a professional passion and skillset for database architecture and data engineering.

I currently work as a Senior Data Analyst at US Foods in their enterprise data organization, primarily supporting the Safety and Warehousing domains. I previously worked at General Motors in the Global Markets IT organization. Most of the projects I work on outside of US Foods use different tools and skillsets than I do during my day job. The reason being that I want to stay up to date with all of the tools and changes in the industry. As a result, I get to play with all of the cool licensed tools like `dbt`,`Snowflake`, `Databricks`, and `Power BI` at work, but I get to build and learn with open source tools externally. 

Since really jumping in to open source development and learning in 2024, I've come to enjoy the study and field of data even more. I know that long term I want to move into a data strategy and innovation role. I'm also interested in eventually pursuing a PhD, either in a Data Engineering capacity or looking at performance optimization for data applications-- think using `duckdb` instead of `pandas`. Designing and architecting systems that enable people to get more out of their data is something I'm teaching myself now. That being said, I'm enthralled with both the process and my progress. 

In the long run, I want to continue working full time as a Data Engineer (or something similar). That being said, for the time being, I am interested in advising or consulting both individuals and companies on data strategy.

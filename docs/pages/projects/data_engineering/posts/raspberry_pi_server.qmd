I used a combination of ChatGPT and Claude to create an outline and then detailed guides for each step, respectively. In my experience, Claude handles the detailed guides and explanations better, but I still make sure to check, test, and proofread everything it gives me. 

This guide provides step-by-step instructions and explanations for configuring a Raspberry Pi 4 to learn about hardware, servers, virtualization, and distributed computing systems.

---

## **1. Initial Setup**
### **Hardware Requirements**
- Raspberry Pi 4
- Micro HDMI to HDMI cord (for direct access)
- Keyboard (connected via USB for direct access)
- 1TB Samsung T7 SSD (connected via USB)
- Amazon Basics 128GB microSD card (or other microSD cards for boot media)
- SSH-capable devices for headless access

### **Installing Linux Server LTS on the SSD**
1. **Prepare the SSD:**
   - Flash the Linux Server LTS image onto the SSD using tools like `balenaEtcher`, `dd`, or `rpi-imager`.
2. **Boot from the SSD:**
   - Connect the SSD to the Raspberry Pi.
   - Connect the Raspberry Pi to the power source.

## SSH

This section provides a thorough walkthrough of setting up and securing SSH (Secure Shell) on a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu Server. SSH is a network protocol that creates an encrypted tunnel between computers, allowing secure remote management. Think of it as establishing a private, secure telephone line that only authorized parties can use to communicate.

### Understanding SSH Configuration Files

Before diving into the setup, it's important to understand the key configuration files:

#### SSH Client vs Server Configuration

The SSH system uses two main configuration files with distinct purposes:

1. `ssh_config`:
   - Lives on your client machine (like your laptop)
   - Controls how your system behaves when connecting to other SSH servers
   - Affects outgoing SSH connections
   - Located at `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` (system-wide) and `~/.ssh/config` (user-specific)

2. `sshd_config`:
   - Lives on your server (the Raspberry Pi)
   - Controls how your SSH server accepts incoming connections
   - Determines who can connect and how
   - Located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
   - Requires root privileges to modify
   - Changes require restarting the SSH service

### Key-Based Authentication Setup

#### Understanding SSH Keys and Security

This guide uses ECDSA-384 keys, which offer several advantages:
- Uses the NIST P-384 curve, providing security equivalent to 192-bit symmetric encryption
- Better resistance to potential quantum computing attacks compared to smaller key sizes
- Standardized under FIPS 186-4
- Excellent balance between security and performance

#### Generating Your SSH Keys

On your laptop, generate a new SSH key pair:

```bash
# Generate a new SSH key pair using ECDSA-384
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 384 -C "ubuntu-pi-server"
```

This command:
- `-t ecdsa`: Specifies the ECDSA algorithm
- `-b 384`: Sets the key size to 384 bits
- `-C "ubuntu-pi-server"`: Adds a descriptive comment

The command generates two files:
- `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`: Your private key (keep this secret!)
- `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub`: Your public key (safe to share)

#### Installing Your Public Key on the Raspberry Pi

Transfer your public key to the Pi:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub chris@ubuntu-pi-server
```

This command:
1. Connects to your Pi using password authentication
2. Creates the `.ssh` directory if needed
3. Adds your public key to `authorized_keys`
4. Sets appropriate permissions automatically

### Server-Side SSH Configuration

#### Understanding Server Host Keys

Your Pi's `/etc/ssh` directory contains several important files:
- Host key pairs (public and private) for different algorithms
- Configuration files and directories
- The moduli file for key exchange

#### Optimizing Server Security

1. Back up the original configuration:
```bash
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

2. Create a custom security configuration:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/99-custom-security.conf
```

Add these security settings:
```bash
# Disable password authentication
PasswordAuthentication no

# Disable root login
PermitRootLogin no

# Specify allowed users
AllowUsers chris

# Use SSH Protocol 2
Protocol 2

# Set idle timeout (optional)
ClientAliveInterval 300
ClientAliveCountMax 2
```

3. Optimize host key settings in sshd_config:
```bash
# Specify host key order (prioritize ECDSA)
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

# Specify key exchange algorithms
KexAlgorithms ecdh-sha2-nistp384,curve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group16-sha512,diffie-hellman-group18-sha512

# Specify host key algorithms
HostKeyAlgorithms ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ssh-ed25519,rsa-sha2-512,rsa-sha2-256
```

4. Strengthen the moduli file:
```bash
# Back up the existing file
sudo cp /etc/ssh/moduli /etc/ssh/moduli.backup

# Remove moduli less than 3072 bits
sudo awk '$5 >= 3072' /etc/ssh/moduli > /tmp/moduli
sudo mv /tmp/moduli /etc/ssh/moduli
```

5. Apply changes:
```bash
# Test the configuration
sudo sshd -t

# Restart the SSH service (on Ubuntu Server)
sudo systemctl restart ssh

# Verify the service status
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

### Client-Side Configuration

#### Setting Up Your SSH Config

Create or edit `~/.ssh/config` on your laptop:

```bash
Host ubuntu-pi-server
    HostName ubuntu-pi-server
    User chris
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
    Port 22
```

::: {.callout-note title="SSH Config: Include"}
If your ssh isn't picking up on the ~/.ssh/ssh_config then you might need to specify it in the system config. Find the line in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` that says **Include** and add the absolute file path. If you need to include more than your user specific config, such as the default `/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*` just add that absolute path separated by a space from any other path included.
:::

#### Managing Known Hosts

1. Back up your current known_hosts file:
```bash
cp ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts.backup
```

2. View current entries:
```bash
ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

3. Remove old entries:
```bash
# Remove specific host
ssh-keygen -R ubuntu-pi-server
```

4. Hash your known_hosts file for security:
```bash
ssh-keygen -H -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

### Additional Security Measures

#### Firewall Configuration

```bash
# Install UFW
sudo apt install ufw

# Allow SSH connections
sudo ufw allow ssh

# Enable the firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

#### Fail2Ban
Fail2Ban is a security tool designed to protect servers from brute force attacks. It works by monitoring log files for specified patterns, identifying suspicious activity (like multiple failed login attempts), and banning the offending IP addresses using firewall rules for a set period. It's especially useful for securing SSH, FTP, and web services.

The best part is the project is entirely open source, you can view the source code and contribute [here](https://https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban).

```bash
# Install Fail2Ban
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fail2ban

# Start and enable Fail2Ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
```


### System Updates

Keep your system updated:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Regular Security Checks

1. Monitor SSH login attempts:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u ssh
```

2. Check authentication logs:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

#### Key Management Best Practices

1. Protect your private key:
- Use a strong passphrase
- Never share or copy to unsecured devices
- Keep secure backups

2. Verify file permissions:
```bash
# On your laptop
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub

# On your Pi
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Troubleshooting

If you can't connect:

1. Verify SSH service status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

2. Check SSH connectivity:
```bash
# Test SSH connection verbosely
ssh -v chris@ubuntu-pi-server
```

3. Verify host key fingerprints:
```bash
# On the Pi
ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
```

Remember: When you see a host key verification prompt, always verify the fingerprint matches your server's key before accepting.

## Conclusion

This configuration provides a robust, secure SSH setup for your Raspberry Pi. It uses modern cryptography (ECDSA-384) while maintaining compatibility with other systems. Regular monitoring and maintenance will help ensure your server remains secure.

Remember to keep your private keys secure and regularly update your system. If you need to make changes to the SSH configuration, always test them before disconnecting from your current session to avoid being locked out.

## System Backups and Upgrades
### Comprehensive Linux Configuration Backup Guide for Raspberry Pi Server

This guide explains how to create a complete backup of Linux configurations and system files on a Raspberry Pi Server running Ubuntu Server LTS using rsync. We'll use rsync because it provides several important advantages over simple copy commands:

- Incremental backups that only transfer changed files
- Preservation of file permissions, ownership, and timestamps
- Built-in compression for efficient transfers
- Detailed progress information and logging
- The ability to resume interrupted transfers

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi Server running Ubuntu Server LTS
- Physical keyboard access
- Root or sudo privileges
- Mounted backup drive at `/mnt/backup/`
- rsync (typically pre-installed on Ubuntu Server)

### Setting Up the Backup Directory

First, we'll prepare the backup directory structure and set appropriate permissions:

```bash
# Create backup directories if they don't exist
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/backup/configs
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/backup/system

# Change ownership to your user (replace 'chris' with your username)
sudo chown -R chris:chris /mnt/backup

# Set appropriate permissions
sudo chmod 700 /mnt/backup  # Only owner can read/write/execute
```

### Configuration Files Backup

We'll use rsync to create a structured backup of essential configuration files. The following script demonstrates how to perform the backup while preserving all file attributes:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Using the {} around DATEYMD in the file path ensure it's specified as the variable's value, and the subsequent parts are not included

DATEYMD=$(date +%Y%m%d)
BACKUP_DIR="/mnt/backup/configs/$DATEYMD"
LOG_DIR="/mnt/backup/logs"
LOG_FILE="$LOG_DIR/${DATEYMD}_config_backup.log"

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

{
    # 1. User and Group Information
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/passwd "$BACKUP_DIR/passwd.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/group "$BACKUP_DIR/group.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/shadow "$BACKUP_DIR/shadow.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/gshadow "$BACKUP_DIR/gshadow.bak"

    # 2. Crontab Configurations
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/crontab "$BACKUP_DIR/"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /var/spool/cron/crontabs/. "$BACKUP_DIR/crontabs/"

    # 3. SSH Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/ssh/. "$BACKUP_DIR/ssh/"
    sudo rsync -aAXv ~/.ssh/. "$BACKUP_DIR/user_ssh/"

    # 4. UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/ufw/. "$BACKUP_DIR/ufw/"
    sudo ufw status verbose > "$BACKUP_DIR/ufw_rules.txt"

    # 5. Fail2Ban Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/fail2ban/. "$BACKUP_DIR/fail2ban/"

    # 6. Network Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/network/. "$BACKUP_DIR/network/"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/hosts "$BACKUP_DIR/hosts.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/hostname "$BACKUP_DIR/hostname.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/resolv.conf "$BACKUP_DIR/resolv.conf.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf "$BACKUP_DIR/wpa_supplicant.conf.bak"

    # 7. Package Manager Configurations (apt)
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/apt/. "$BACKUP_DIR/apt/"

    # 8. Systemd Services and Timers
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/systemd/system/. "$BACKUP_DIR/systemd/"

    # 9. Logrotate Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/logrotate.conf "$BACKUP_DIR/logrotate.conf.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/logrotate.d/. "$BACKUP_DIR/logrotate.d/"

    # 10. Custom Application Configurations (add more as needed)
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/myapp/. "$BACKUP_DIR/myapp/"

    # 11. Timezone and Locale
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/timezone "$BACKUP_DIR/timezone.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/localtime "$BACKUP_DIR/localtime.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/default/locale "$BACKUP_DIR/locale.bak"

    # 12. Keyboard Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/default/keyboard "$BACKUP_DIR/keyboard.bak"

    # 13. Package List
    dpkg --get-selections > "$BACKUP_DIR/package_list.txt"

    # Set appropriate permissions
    sudo chown -R chris:chris "$BACKUP_DIR"
    sudo chmod -R 600 "$BACKUP_DIR"

    echo "Configuration backup completed at: $BACKUP_DIR"

} > "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1

echo "Logs available at: $LOG_FILE"
```

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x /scripts/config_backup.sh
```

### System Files Backup

For system files, we'll create a separate rsync script that handles system directories efficiently:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

DATEYMD=$(date +%Y%m%d)
BACKUP_DIR="/mnt/backup/system/$DATEYMD"
LOG_DIR="/mnt/backup/logs"
LOG_FILE="$LOG_DIR/${DATEYMD}_system_backup.log"



# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

{
    # Starting script
    echo "Starting system backup at: $(date)"
    echo "Backup directory: $BACKUP_DIR"

    # The --one-file-system option prevents crossing filesystem boundaries
    # --hard-links preserves hard links
    # --acls and --xattrs preserve extended attributes
    sudo rsync -aAXv --one-file-system --hard-links \
        --exclude="/mnt/" \
        / "$BACKUP_DIR"

    # 2. System Information Files
    # Partition layout
    sudo fdisk -l > "$BACKUP_DIR/partition_layout.txt"
    # Disk UUIDs
    sudo blkid > "$BACKUP_DIR/disk_uuids.txt"

    # Set appropriate permissions
    sudo chown -R chris:chris "$BACKUP_DIR"
    sudo chmod -R 600 "$BACKUP_DIR"

    echo "System backup completed at: $BACKUP_DIR."

} > "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1

echo "Logs available at: $LOG_FILE"
```

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x /scripts/system_backup.sh
```

### Understanding the rsync Options

The rsync commands use several important options:

- `-a`: Archive mode, preserves almost everything
- `-A`: Preserve ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- `-X`: Preserve extended attributes
- `-v`: Verbose output
- `--one-file-system`: Don't cross filesystem boundaries
- `--hard-links`: Preserve hard links
- `--exclude`: Skip specified directories

### **Note:**
**Everything up until this point has been tested and works-- relatively efficiently for such a simple setup. That being said, I still haven't tested the restore script, nor have I tried to setup simple cron jobs to automate and cleanup the backups.**

### Restoring from Backup

To restore your system from these backups:

```bash
# 1. Restore configuration files
sudo rsync -aAXv /mnt/backup/configs/[TIMESTAMP]/passwd.bak /etc/passwd
sudo rsync -aAXv /mnt/backup/configs/[TIMESTAMP]/group.bak /etc/group
sudo rsync -aAXv /mnt/backup/configs/[TIMESTAMP]/ssh/ /etc/ssh/
sudo rsync -aAXv /mnt/backup/configs/[TIMESTAMP]/ufw/ /etc/ufw/
sudo rsync -aAXv /mnt/backup/configs/[TIMESTAMP]/fail2ban/ /etc/fail2ban/

# 2. Restore installed packages
sudo dpkg --set-selections < /mnt/backup/configs/[TIMESTAMP]/package_list.txt
sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade

# 3. For a full system restore
sudo rsync -aAXv --delete /mnt/backup/system/[TIMESTAMP]/ /
```

### Important Notes

1. The `--delete` option during restore will remove files at the destination that don't exist in the backup. Use with caution.
2. Consider using rsync's `--dry-run` option to test backups and restores without making changes.
3. The backup includes sensitive system files. Store it securely and restrict access.
4. Consider encrypting the backup directory for additional security.
5. Test the restore process in a safe environment before using in production.

### Automating the Backup

Create a master backup script that runs both configuration and system backups:

```bash
# Create master backup script (save as master-backup.sh)
cat << 'EOF' > /mnt/backup/master-backup.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set up logging
exec 1> >(logger -s -t $(basename $0)) 2>&1

# Run configuration backup
/mnt/backup/backup-configs.sh

# Run system backup
/mnt/backup/backup-system.sh

# Remove backups older than 30 days
find /mnt/backup/configs/ -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} +
find /mnt/backup/system/ -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} +
EOF

# Make the script executable
chmod +x /mnt/backup/master-backup.sh

# Add to crontab (run daily at 2 AM)
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 2 * * * /mnt/backup/master-backup.sh") | crontab -
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check rsync error messages with `--verbose` option
2. Verify sufficient disk space with `df -h`
3. Monitor backup progress with `--progress` option
4. Check system logs: `sudo journalctl -u cron`
5. Verify file permissions and ownership
6. Test network connectivity for remote backups

Remember to regularly verify your backups by checking the log files and occasionally testing the restore process in a safe environment.

## **2. Configuring MicroSD Cards**
### **Purpose of MicroSD Cards**
- Experiment with other OS installations (e.g., NetBSD).
- Use one card as a backup Linux bootloader.
- Allocate one card for portable environments or additional storage.

### **Steps to Use MicroSD Cards**
1. **Format the Cards:**
   - Use `gparted` on Linux or similar tools to format the cards.
   - Choose `FAT32` for compatibility or `ext4` for Linux systems.
2. **Install Operating Systems:**
   - Download the desired OS images (e.g., NetBSD).
   - Flash the image to the card using `balenaEtcher` or `Raspberry Pi Imager`.
3. **Switching OS:**
   - Insert the appropriate microSD card and reboot the Raspberry Pi.

---

## **3. Partitioning the SSD**
### **Why Partition the SSD?**
- Organize storage for multiple OS installations or shared data.
- Separate OS environments and workloads.

### **Steps to Partition the SSD**
1. **Install Partitioning Tools:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install gparted
   ```
2. **Create Partitions:**
   - Open `gparted` and select your SSD.
   - Create the following partitions:
     - **Partition 1:** Linux root (e.g., 100GB, ext4).
     - **Partition 2:** NetBSD or another OS (e.g., 100GB, FFS).
     - **Partition 3:** Shared storage (remaining space, ext4 or exFAT).

3. **Mount Partitions:**
   - Add entries to `/etc/fstab` for automatic mounting during boot. Replace `xxxx-xxxx` with your partition's UUID, which can be found using `lsblk -f`:
     ```bash
     UUID=xxxx-xxxx /mnt/shared ext4 defaults 0 2
     ```
   - Save and exit the file, then run:
     ```bash
     sudo mount -a
     ```
   - Verify the partitions are mounted correctly with:
     ```bash
     df -h
     ```

## **4. LXC vs. LXD**
### **Definitions**
- **LXC:** Low-level tool for managing lightweight containers that share the host OS kernel.
- **LXD:** High-level manager for LXC, adding user-friendly features, API, and support for virtual machines (VMs).

| Feature                  | LXC                          | LXD                          |

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}
I used a combination of ChatGPT and Claude to create an outline and then detailed guides for each step, respectively. In my experience, Claude handles the detailed guides and explanations better, but I still make sure to check, test, and proofread everything it gives me. 

This guide provides step-by-step instructions and explanations for configuring a Raspberry Pi 4 to learn about hardware, servers, containerization, and self-hosting principles. Eventually, I'd like to setup an actual server cluster and self-host some interesting, more resource-intensive applications. Before I make that kind of commitment, I wanted to learn the basics and see if this is something I would enjoy-- the good news, I learned I do. The great news, Raspberry Pi makes their hardware very affordable and easy to purchase. Here's the official webpage for the exact computer I [bought](https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-8gb/?searchid=0&search_query=Raspberry+Pi+4). 

It's worth adding, I bought the 8GB Raspberry Pi 4. The price difference isn't that great, but the performance is between the lesser 2GB and 4GB models. Additionally, because I'm planning to host and experiment with CI/CD, I also bought a case and cooling fan to help with longevity. All in, the base price for that (with the power supply and HDMI cable) is $107.30 before taxes, shipping, and other fees.

## Starting from (*close*) to Zero {#sec-requirements}
### Hardware Requirements
This section will provide basic setup instructions, so you'll have the same tools I do and can follow along with this guide, step-by-step.

- Raspberry Pi 4 8GB
- Micro HDMI to HDMI cord (for direct access)
- Appropriate Power Supply
- Keyboard (connected via USB for direct access)
- 1TB Samsung T7 SSD (connected via USB for boot media/core memory)
- Amazon Basics 128GB microSD card (or other microSD cards for backups media)
- SSH-capable devices for headless access
  - I'm using a MacBook Air
  - I prefer the MacOS and Terminal for personal development, because I use Windows at my day job

### Image requirements 
Once you have your hardware ready to go, you can being setting up the software. I'm using Linux Server LTS because it's a stable version of Linux intended for headless, server environments. LTS means ***long-term support***, so unlike the more frequently updated versions, these OS versions are supported for 5 years. Additionally, you'll want to use ***public-key authentication*** for better security purposes, but more on that in the [SSH Section](@sec-ssh).

1. Have your SSD ready and able to connect to your laptop or desktop (whichever you plan to use with SSH)
2. Download Raspberry Pi Imager from the official [website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
3. Run the Imager and configure your installation of the most recent Linux Server LTS image
   1. **Select your Raspberry Pi device**
   
   ![](images/ubuntu-pi-device.png)

   2. **Select the OS Image you want to flash**
   
   ![](images/ubuntu-pi-os.png)

   3. **Select the media storage device for the image**
   
   ![](images/ubuntu-pi-storage.png)

   4. **Configure settings**
   
   ![](images/ubuntu-pi-config-general.png)
   Here, you'll configure your primary user ID and password; network connection; locale and timezone; and your hostname (the nickname your computer remembers the IP address as). 

   ![](images/ubuntu-pi-config-service.png)
   Here, you'll configure your SSH settings. Remember to use ***public-key authentication*** only, and to keep the private key generated on your local machine safe.

   ![](images/ubuntu-pi-config-options.png)
   These are more preference based, but it's nice to have the storage device automatically eject once the flashing is complete. Then, you just need to unplug it and plug it into your Raspberry Pi to get going.

### Initial Boot
Now you're ready to plug your boot media device (the SSD) into your Raspberry Pi. You can also connect a keyboard, monitor, and power supply. Once all of this is connected, your Raspberry Pi will boot up. Connecting a monitor and keyboard will allow your to directly interact with the system's terminal. Ideally, you'll use SSH, but it may be helpful to have direct access in case there are any network issues.

If you first connect from the wired keyboard, let all of the start up processes finish running (these will *hopefully* have brackets with the word `Success` in green). Then, type in the name of the User ID you wish to login with, in my case it's `chris`. Then, enter the password (no characters will show up as you type it in) and hit enter. You'll see a plaintext ASCII message telling you the OS version, some system information (memory usage, temperature, etc.), and you'll see a line where you can enter commands (the CLI). In my case, it looks like this: `chris@ubuntu-pi-server:~$ `

Now you can run some basic commands to see where you are and what you have available to you. Spoiler alert, you're in your home directory and have no files. In my case it's `/home/chris`, where the `/home` directory is owned by *root* and `/chris` is owned by my user-- UID 1000 (the default for new users on a fresh system/image). Right now your directory will be empty, outside of some hidden folders like `.ssh`. More on this later.

Next we'll cover the basic structure of the Linux Server OS as well as go over some basic network connectivity and configurations.

## Networking Basics
This section provides a brief example of how to connect your server to WiFi. It assumes you are already connected using the wireless network settings you configured in the [Requirements Section](@sec-requirements). That being said, I'll also go over some basic networking concepts and background information. As a result, some of the decisiions and terminology in this guide will make more sense (it also helps me remember what I'm doing and why).

### Computer Networking
Simply put, a computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other using a set of rules called protocols. Networking allows devices to share resources, exchange data, and collaborate on tasks. On a deeper level, it helps to understand the conceptual models that describes how data moves through a network. Before we dive in, let's go over some basic terminology. 

#### Key Terms

**Basic Networking Concepts:**

- **Protocol:** A set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between devices on a network. Examples include TCP, UDP, and HTTP.
- **MAC Address:** Media Access Control address; a unique hardware identifier assigned to network interfaces. It's a 48-bit address (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E) permanently assigned to a network adapter.
- **IP Address:** A numerical label assigned to each device on a network that uses the Internet Protocol. Functions like a postal address for devices.
- **Packet:** A unit of data transmitted over a network. Includes both the data payload and header information for routing.
- **Subnet:** A logical subdivision of an IP network that allows for more efficient routing and security segmentation.
- **Gateway:** A network node that serves as an access point to another network, typically connecting a local network to the wider internet.
- **DNS:** Domain Name System; translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses computers can understand.
- **DHCP:** Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol; automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices.

**Network Types and Components:**

- **LAN:** Local Area Network; a network confined to a small geographic area, like a home or office.
- **WAN:** Wide Area Network; connects multiple LANs across large geographic distances.
- **Router:** A device that forwards data packets between computer networks, determining the best path for data transmission.
- **Switch:** A networking device that connects devices within a single network and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.
- **Bandwidth:** The maximum data transfer rate of a network connection, measured in bits per second (bps).
- **Latency:** The delay between sending and receiving data, typically measured in milliseconds.
  
**Linux Networking Terminology:**

- **Interface:** A connection between a device and a network. In Linux, these have names like eth0 (Ethernet) or wlan0 (wireless).
- **Netplan:** Ubuntu's default network configuration tool that uses YAML files to define network settings.
- **systemd-networkd:** A system daemon that manages network configurations in modern Linux distributions.
- **NetworkManager:** An alternative network management daemon that provides detection and configuration for automatic network connectivity.
- **Socket:** An endpoint for sending or receiving data across a network, defined by an IP address and port number.

**Security Concepts:**

- **Firewall:** Software or hardware that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **SSH:** Secure Shell; a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication and remote command execution.
- **Encryption:** The process of encoding information to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Port:** A virtual point where network connections start and end. Ports are identified by numbers (0-65535).
- **NAT:** Network Address Translation; allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.
- **VPN:** Virtual Private Network; extends a private network across a public network, enabling secure data transmission.

#### The OSI Model
Now that you understand some common terms and concepts, we can dive into the conceptual models. The ***Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)*** Model divides networking into seven layers, each handling specific aspects of network communication.

1. **Physical Layer**: Physical medium, electrical signals, cables, and hardware
2. **Data Link Layer**: Physical addressing (MAC addresses), error detection
3. **Network Layer**: Logical addressing (IP addresses), routing
4. **Transport Layer**: End-to-end connections, reliability (TCP/UDP)
5. **Session Layer**: Session establishment, management, and termination
6. **Presentation Layer**: Data translation, encryption, compression
7. **Application Layer**: User interfaces and services (HTTP, SMTP, etc.)

#### The TCP/IP Model
The OSI Model is conceptual, but the ***TCP/IP Model*** is more practical and has four layers.

1. **Network Access Layer:**Combines OSI's Physical and Data Link layers
2. **Internet Layer:** Similar to OSI's Network layer (IP)
3. **Transport Layer:** Same as OSI's Transport layer (TCP/UDP)
4. **Application Layer:** Combines OSI's Session, Presentation, and Application layers

#### Network Protocols
Remember, a protocol is a set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between devices on a network. You can think of protocols in one of two camps, *Connection-Oriented* and *Connectionless*. Within these camps, two protocols stand out as the backbone of the internet's data transfers: **TCP** and **UDP**. 

***TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)*** is a connection-oriented protocol that establishes a dedicated end-to-end connection before transmitting data. TCP is used when reliability is more important than speed (e.g., web browsing, email, file transfers). It has four defining traits:

- **Reliability:** Guarantees delivery of packets in the correct order
- **Flow Control:** Prevents overwhelming receivers with too much data
- **Error Detection:** Identifies and retransmits lost or corrupted packets
- **Handshake Process:** Three-way handshake establishes connections

***UDP (User Datagram Protocol)*** is a connectionless protocol that sends data without establishing a dedicated connection. UDP is used for real-time applications (e.g., video streaming, VoIP, online gaming). It also has four defining traits:

- **Simplicity:** No connection setup or maintenance overhead
- **Speed:** Faster than TCP due to fewer checks and guarantees
- **Lower Reliability:** No guarantee of delivery or correct ordering
- **Efficiency:** Better for real-time applications where occasional data loss is acceptable

Beyond those, there are some other important protocols to know, because they provide the foundation for most of the user friendly features we are used to today.

- ***IP (Internet Protocol)***
  - IP handles addressing and routing of packets across networks. There are two versions in common use:
  - IPv4: 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
  - IPv6: 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)
- ***ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)***
  - ICMP helps diagnose network issues by sending error messages and operational information. The ping command uses ICMP to test connectivity.
- ***HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)***
  - HTTP and its secure variant HTTPS are application-layer protocols used for web browsing.
- ***DNS (Domain Name System)***
  - DNS translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.

### Network Connections
There are two ways for systems to connect to the internet: **wired** and **wireless**.

#### Wired Connections
***Ethernet*** is the most common wired networking technology. Its name comes from the term *ether* referring to a theoretical medium that was believed to carry light waves through space. It was developed by Robert Metcalf and David Boggs at Xerox's PARC facility in the 1970s. The goal was to provide a more stable LAN which could facilitate high speed transfers between computers and laser printers. They succeeded, and had improved on a precursor's, ALOHAnet, design by creating a system that could detect collisions-- when two devices try to transmit at the same time. Here are some key traits:

- **Reliability:** Less susceptible to interference
- **Speed:** Typically faster and more stable than wireless
- **Security:** Harder to intercept without physical access
- **Connectors:** RJ45 connectors on Ethernet cables
- **Standards:** 10/100/1000 Mbps (Gigabit) are common speeds

#### Wireless Connections
***Wi-Fi*** allows devices to connect to networks without physical cables. Its name is ***not*** short for *Wireless Fidelity*, but actually a marketing choice by the brand-consulting firm Interbrand. They chose the name because it sounded similar to Hi-Fi. Wi-Fi was developed by numerous researchers and engineers, but the key breakthrough was by Dr. John O'Sullivan from CSIRO in Australia. His work focused on a wireless LAN, which would eventually become the ***IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)*** 802.11 standard in 1997. Eventually, Apple would help with widespread adoption by including the AirPort feature on its laptops, enabling W-Fi connectivity out of the box. Here are some key traits:

- **Convenience:** No cables required, more flexible placement
- **Standards:** 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax (Wi-Fi 6) with varying speeds and ranges
- **Security:** WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 encryption standards (WPA2/WPA3 recommended)

#### Network Interface Names in Linux
In Ubuntu Server, network interfaces follow a predictable naming convention:

- **eth0, eth1:** Traditional Ethernet interface names
- **wlan0, wlan1:** Traditional wireless interface names
- **enp2s0, wlp3s0:** Modern predictable interface names (based on device location)

#### IP Addressing
An ***IP (Internet Protocol) Address***, is a unique identifier for a device on the internet, or a LAN. There are two different kinds of addresses: ***IPv4*** and ***IPv6***. 

***IPv4*** uses 32-bit addresses, providing approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses (now largely exhausted):

- **Format:** Four octets (numbers 0-255) separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **Classes:** Traditionally divided into classes A, B, C, D, and E
- **Private Ranges:**
  - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
  - 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
  - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
- **Subnet Masks:** Used to divide networks (e.g., 255.255.255.0 or /24)
- **Issues:** IPv4 address exhaustion due to limited capacity

***IPv6*** uses 128-bit addresses, providing approximately 3.4×10^38 unique addresses:

- **Format:** Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)
- **Shorthand:** Leading zeros in a group can be omitted, and consecutive groups of zeros can be replaced with :: (only once)
  - **Example:** 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334
- **Address Types:**
  - **Unicast:** Single interface
  - **Anycast:** Multiple interfaces (closest responds)
  - **Multicast:** Multiple interfaces (all respond)
- **Benefits:** More addresses, improved security, simplified headers, no need for NAT
  
One final note, ***CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)*** notation represents IP addresses and their associated routing prefix:
- **Format:** IP address followed by "/" and prefix length (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- **Calculation:** A prefix of /24 means the first 24 bits are the network portion, leaving 8 bits for hosts (allowing 2^8 = 256 addresses)

### Ubuntu Server Networking Tools
Now that we've covered the basic concepts, it's time to dive into the actual commands and tools that will let you configure and manage your server's network. To start, you can view network interfaces and their statuses using the command `ip link show`, or `ip addr show` for your IP Address configuration. You can view only the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses using `ip -4 addr` or `ip -6 addr`, respectively.

#### Testing Connectivity
Although it seems redundant if you already viewed your IP addresses, you can also test connectivity using the `ping` and `traceroute` commands. These will be more useful for checking your servers network status from your desktop or laptop. 

**Test basic connectivity to a host:**
```bash
ping google.com
```

**Trace the route to a destination:**
```bash
traceroute google.com
```
**Check the DNS resolution:**
```bash
nslookup google.com
# dig google.com
```

#### Viewing Network Statistics
You can view more specific network information with the `ss` command. This command's name is an acronym for `socket statistics` and is used as a replacement for the older netstat plan because it offers faster performance and a more detailed output. Additionally, you can filter by specific protocol.

```bash
ss -tuln
```

The `tuln` flag is made up of four separate flags:

- `-t`, displays only TCP sockets
- `-u`, displays only UDP sockets
- `-l`, displays listening sockets
- `-n`, displays address numerically, instead of resolving them

#### Configuration Files
Finally, there are a few crucial configuration files that will handle the bulk of your networking. In Ubuntu Server, network interfaces and DNS configurations are configured and stored in the `/etc/` directory.

**Network Interfaces:**

- `/etc/netplan/:` Contains YAML configuration files for Netplan
- `/etc/network/interfaces:` Configuration method (if NetworkManager is used)

**DNS Configuration:**

- **/etc/resolv.conf:** DNS resolver configuration
- **/etc/hosts:** Static hostname to IP mappings
- **/etc/hostname:** System hostname

### Netplan
Netplan is the default network configuration tool in Ubuntu Server, introduced in Ubuntu 17.10. It uses YAML files to define network configurations and generates the appropriate configuration for the chosen backend renderer.

## SSH {#sec-ssh}

This section provides a thorough walkthrough of setting up and securing SSH (Secure Shell) on a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu Server. SSH is a network protocol that creates an encrypted tunnel between computers, allowing secure remote management. Think of it as establishing a private, secure telephone line that only authorized parties can use to communicate.

### Understanding SSH Configuration Files

Before diving into the setup, it's important to understand the key configuration files:

#### SSH Client vs Server Configuration

The SSH system uses two main configuration files with distinct purposes:

1. `ssh_config`:
   - Lives on your client machine (like your laptop)
   - Controls how your system behaves when connecting to other SSH servers
   - Affects outgoing SSH connections
   - Located at `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` (system-wide) and `~/.ssh/config` (user-specific)
     - If your server ever moves or connects to a new IP address, simply update it in the user config file

2. `sshd_config`:
   - Lives on your server (the Raspberry Pi)
   - Controls how your SSH server accepts incoming connections
   - Determines who can connect and how
   - Located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
   - Requires root privileges to modify
   - Changes require restarting the SSH service

### Key-Based Authentication Setup

#### Understanding SSH Keys and Security

This guide uses ECDSA-384 keys, which offer several advantages:

- Uses the NIST P-384 curve, providing security equivalent to 192-bit symmetric encryption
- Better resistance to potential quantum computing attacks compared to smaller key sizes
- Standardized under FIPS 186-4
- Excellent balance between security and performance

#### Generating Your SSH Keys

On your laptop, generate a new SSH key pair:

```bash
# Generate a new SSH key pair using ECDSA-384
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 384 -C "ubuntu-pi-server"
```

This command:

- `-t ecdsa`: Specifies the ECDSA algorithm
- `-b 384`: Sets the key size to 384 bits
- `-C "ubuntu-pi-server"`: Adds a descriptive comment

The command generates two files:

- `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`: Your private key (keep this secret!)
- `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub`: Your public key (safe to share)

#### Installing Your Public Key on the Raspberry Pi

Transfer your public key to the Pi:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub chris@ubuntu-pi-server
```

This command:

1. Connects to your Pi using password authentication
   1. If you're restoring your config, you'll need to temporarily set ***PasswordAuthentication*** in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to yes
2. Creates the `.ssh` directory if needed
3. Adds your public key to `authorized_keys`
4. Sets appropriate permissions automatically

### Server-Side SSH Configuration

#### Understanding Server Host Keys

Your Pi's `/etc/ssh` directory contains several important files:
- Host key pairs (public and private) for different algorithms
- Configuration files and directories
- The moduli file for key exchange

#### Optimizing Server Security

1. Back up the original configuration:
```bash
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

2. Optimize host key settings in sshd_config:
```bash
# Specify host key order (prioritize ECDSA)
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
```

3. Strengthen the moduli file:
```bash
# Back up the existing file
sudo cp /etc/ssh/moduli /etc/ssh/moduli.backup

# Remove moduli less than 3072 bits
sudo awk '$5 >= 3072' /etc/ssh/moduli > /tmp/moduli
sudo mv /tmp/moduli /etc/ssh/moduli
```

4. Apply changes:
```bash
# Test the configuration
sudo sshd -t

# Restart the SSH service (on Ubuntu Server)
sudo systemctl restart ssh

# Verify the service status
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

Just note, you'll probably need to reboot (`sudo reboot`) your server before all of the changes fully take place. Once you've done that, you may need to run `sudo systemctl start ssh`.

### Client-Side Configuration

#### Setting Up Your SSH Config

Create or edit `~/.ssh/config` on your laptop:

```bash
Host ubuntu-pi-server
    HostName ubuntu-pi-server
    User chris
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
    Port 22
```

::: {.callout-note title="SSH Config: Include"}
If your ssh isn't picking up on the ~/.ssh/ssh_config then you might need to specify it in the system config. Find the line in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` that says **Include** and add the absolute file path. If you need to include more than your user specific config, such as the default `/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/*` just add that absolute path separated by a space from any other path included.
:::

#### Managing Known Hosts

1. Back up your current known_hosts file:
```bash
cp ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts.backup
```

2. View current entries:
```bash
ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

3. Remove old entries:
```bash
# Remove specific host
ssh-keygen -R ubuntu-pi-server
```

4. Hash your known_hosts file for security:
```bash
ssh-keygen -H -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

#### Securing the Key File

When using SSH key-based authentication, adding a password to your key enhances security by requiring a passphrase to use the key. This guide explains how to add and remove a password from an existing SSH key.

**Adding a Password to an SSH Key**

If you already have an SSH key and want to add a password to it, use the following command:

```sh
ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Explanation:

    -p : Prompts for changing the passphrase.
    -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa : Specifies the key file to modify (adjust if your key has a different name).
    You will be asked for the current passphrase (leave blank if none) and then set a new passphrase.

**Removing a Password from an SSH Key**

If you want to remove the passphrase from an SSH key, run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""
```

Explanation:

    -N "" : Sets an empty passphrase (removes the password).
    The tool will ask for the current passphrase before removing it.

Verifying the Changes

After modifying the key, test the SSH connection from your CLI, or using an SSH tunnel.

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@your-server
```

If you added a passphrase, you'll be prompted to enter it when connecting.

By using a passphrase, your SSH key is protected against unauthorized use in case it gets compromised. If you frequently use your SSH key, consider using an SSH agent (ssh-agent) to cache your passphrase securely.

### Additional Security Measures

#### Firewall Configuration

```bash
# Install UFW (if it isn't already)
sudo apt install ufw

# Allow SSH connections
sudo ufw allow ssh

# Enable the firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

Now, you'll want to add rules for example, allowing traffic on a specific port if you took the step to choose a nonstandard, one that isn't the default **Port 22**. 

```bash
# Add a new rule in the port/protocol format
sudo ufw add 6025/tcp

# See a list of all rules
sudo ufw status numbered

# Remove the default rules
sudo ufw delete 1
```

#### Fail2Ban
Fail2Ban is a security tool designed to protect servers from brute force attacks. It works by monitoring log files for specified patterns, identifying suspicious activity (like multiple failed login attempts), and banning the offending IP addresses using firewall rules for a set period. It's especially useful for securing SSH, FTP, and web services.

The best part is the project is entirely open source, you can view the source code and contribute [here](https://https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban).

```bash
# Install Fail2Ban
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fail2ban

# Start and enable Fail2Ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
```


### System Updates

Keep your system updated:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Regular Security Checks

1. Monitor SSH login attempts:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u ssh
```

2. Check authentication logs:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

#### Key Management Best Practices

1. Protect your private key:
- Use a strong passphrase
- Never share or copy to unsecured devices
- Keep secure backups

2. Verify file permissions:
```bash
# On your laptop
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub

# On your Pi
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Troubleshooting

If you can't connect:

1. Verify SSH service status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

2. Check SSH connectivity:
```bash
# Test SSH connection verbosely
ssh -v chris@ubuntu-pi-server
```

3. Verify host key fingerprints:
```bash
# On the Pi
ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
```

Remember: When you see a host key verification prompt, always verify the fingerprint matches your server's key before accepting.

### Using SCP to Transfer Scripts
This section outlines the process of securely copying Bash scripts from an Ubuntu Pi Server to a MacBook Air using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol), a file transfer tool built on top of SSH. The user should have an SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) set up to simplify connections to their Raspberry Pi server. 

For a few basic scripts, SCP is fine, but for larger file transfers `rsync` is better suited and a more efficient solution.

#### Ensure the SSH Configuration Works

Initially, the `ssh ubuntu-pi-server` command did not use the expected user-specific SSH configuration (`~/.ssh/config`). Instead, it defaulted to the system-wide configuration (`/etc/ssh/ssh_config`).To fix this, I ran the command with the `-F` flag explicitly specifying the user config:

```bash
ssh -F ~/.ssh/config ubuntu-pi-server
```

**Note:** To make sure SSH always uses the correct config, I tried the following:

- Made sure `~/.ssh/config` exists and has the correct permissions (`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config`).
- Modified the `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` to include the user config:
```plaintext
Include ~/.ssh/config
```

After fixing the issue, the command `ssh ubuntu-pi-server` worked as expected.

#### Copying Scripts from Server to MacBook Air
Once SSH was working correctly, the next step was to copy two Bash scripts from the Ubuntu Pi Server to the MacBook Air using `scp`.

The scripts were stored on the Pi as:

```plaintext
/home/chris/scripts/system_backup.sh
/home/chris/scripts/config_backup.sh
```

The following `scp` commands were used to transfer them to the MacBook Air:

```bash
scp ubuntu-pi-server:~/scripts/backup.sh ~/Documents/pi-scripts/
scp ubuntu-pi-server:~/scripts/maintenance.sh ~/Documents/pi-scripts/
```

#### Copying Multiple Files at Once
To copy all Bash scripts from the `scripts` directory in one command:

```bash
scp chris@ubuntu-pi-server:~/mnt/backups/ ~/Documents/pi-scripts/backups
```

#### Copying Files from MacBook Air to Server
Simply enter the command in reverse, but notice here I did things a little differently.

- `-r` tells `scp` to *recursively* copy a directory, meaning it moves it and all of its contents
- `chris@` tells `scp` to specify the user when connecting to the server, this can be helpful if you have connection issues

```bash
scp -r ~/Documents/pi-scripts chris@ubuntu-pi-server:~/scripts
```

#### SCP Notes

- SSH is now correctly configured and working using `ssh ubuntu-pi-server`.
- Bash scripts can be securely copied from the Ubuntu Pi Server to the MacBook Air using `scp`.
  - Just take note of the specific syntax used, namely `server-name:path/to/files`
- The user can now maintain local backups of important scripts efficiently.
  - Enables you to develop where you'd like and then easily move files to test scripts

## Conclusion

This configuration provides a robust, secure SSH setup for your Raspberry Pi. It uses modern cryptography (ECDSA-384) while maintaining compatibility with other systems. Regular monitoring and maintenance will help ensure your server remains secure.

Remember to keep your private keys secure and regularly update your system. If you need to make changes to the SSH configuration, always test them before disconnecting from your current session to avoid being locked out.

## Partitions and Backups
### **Why Partition the SSD?**
- Organize storage for multiple OS installations or shared data.
- Separate OS environments and workloads.

### **Steps to Partition the SSD**
1. **Install Partitioning Tools:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install gparted
   ```
2. **Create Partitions:**
   - Open `gparted` and select your SSD.
   - Create the following partitions:
     - **Partition 1:** Linux root (e.g., 100GB, ext4).
     - **Partition 2:** NetBSD or another OS (e.g., 100GB, FFS).
     - **Partition 3:** Shared storage (remaining space, ext4 or exFAT).

3. **Mount Partitions:**
   - Add entries to `/etc/fstab` for automatic mounting during boot. Replace `xxxx-xxxx` with your partition's UUID, which can be found using `lsblk -f`:
     ```bash
     UUID=xxxx-xxxx /mnt/shared ext4 defaults 0 2
     ```
   - Save and exit the file, then run:
     ```bash
     sudo mount -a
     ```
   - Verify the partitions are mounted correctly with:
     ```bash
     df -h
     ```

## System Backups and Upgrades
### Partitions
Before diving into the actual backup process for your server, it's best to figure out your storage media and partition your drives. Partitions are just logicial divisions in your physical storage, each of which can use different filesystems. With some examples below:

- `ext4`: Standard Linux filesystem
- `FAT32`: Compatible with most systems but limited to 4GB files
- `exFAT`: Enhanced FAT, good for cross-platform use
- `NTFS`: Windows filesystem, readable by Linux

#### Partitioning Tools
Before you can partition your hard drive or another piece of physical storage (like a microSD), you'll need to be connected to your boot media. In my case, that's the 1TB SSD I have plugged into my server. You are not able to partition the active storage device on any server or computer. 

So, your first step is to take a look at the block devices available to you.

```bash
sudo lsblk
```

### Comprehensive Linux Configuration Backup Guide for Raspberry Pi Server

This guide explains how to create a complete backup of Linux configurations and system files on a Raspberry Pi Server running Ubuntu Server LTS using rsync. We'll use rsync because it provides several important advantages over simple copy commands:

- Incremental backups that only transfer changed files
- Preservation of file permissions, ownership, and timestamps
- Built-in compression for efficient transfers
- Detailed progress information and logging
- The ability to resume interrupted transfers

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi Server running Ubuntu Server LTS
- Physical keyboard access
- Root or sudo privileges
- Mounted backup drive at `/mnt/backups/`
- rsync (typically pre-installed on Ubuntu Server)

### Setting Up the Backup Directory

First, we'll prepare the backup directory structure and set appropriate permissions:

```bash
# Create backup directories if they don't exist
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/backups/configs
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/backups/system

# Change ownership to your user (replace 'chris' with your username)
sudo chown -R chris:chris /mnt/backups

# Set appropriate permissions
sudo chmod -R 700 /mnt/backups  # Only owner can read/write/execute
```

### Configuration Files Backup

We'll use rsync to create a structured backup of essential configuration files. The following script demonstrates how to perform the backup while preserving all file attributes:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Using the {} around DATEYMD in the file path ensure it's specified as the variable's value, and the subsequent parts are not included

DATEYMD=$(date +%Y%m%d)
BACKUP_DIR="/mnt/backups/configs/$DATEYMD"
LOG_DIR="/mnt/backups/logs"
LOG_FILE="$LOG_DIR/${DATEYMD}_config_backup.log"

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

{
    # 1. User and Group Information
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/passwd "$BACKUP_DIR/passwd.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/group "$BACKUP_DIR/group.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/shadow "$BACKUP_DIR/shadow.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/gshadow "$BACKUP_DIR/gshadow.bak"

    # 2. Crontab Configurations
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/crontab "$BACKUP_DIR/"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /var/spool/cron/crontabs/. "$BACKUP_DIR/crontabs/"

    # 3. SSH Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/ssh/. "$BACKUP_DIR/ssh/"
    sudo rsync -aAXv ~/.ssh/. "$BACKUP_DIR/user_ssh/"

    # 4. UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/ufw/. "$BACKUP_DIR/ufw/"
    sudo ufw status verbose > "$BACKUP_DIR/ufw_rules.txt"

    # 5. Fail2Ban Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/fail2ban/. "$BACKUP_DIR/fail2ban/"

    # 6. Network Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/network/. "$BACKUP_DIR/network/"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/netplan/. "$BACKUP_DIR/netplan/"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/NetworkManager/. "$BACKUP_DIR/NetworkManager/"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/hosts "$BACKUP_DIR/hosts.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/hostname "$BACKUP_DIR/hostname.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/resolv.conf "$BACKUP_DIR/resolv.conf.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf "$BACKUP_DIR/wpa_supplicant.conf.bak"

    # 7. Package Manager Configurations (apt)
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/apt/. "$BACKUP_DIR/apt/"

    # 8. Systemd Services and Timers
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/systemd/system/. "$BACKUP_DIR/systemd/"

    # 9. Logrotate Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/logrotate.conf "$BACKUP_DIR/logrotate.conf.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/logrotate.d/. "$BACKUP_DIR/logrotate.d/"

    # 10. Timezone and Locale
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/timezone "$BACKUP_DIR/timezone.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/localtime "$BACKUP_DIR/localtime.bak"
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/default/locale "$BACKUP_DIR/locale.bak"

    # 11. Keyboard Configuration
    sudo rsync -aAXv /etc/default/keyboard "$BACKUP_DIR/keyboard.bak"

    # 12. Package List
    dpkg --get-selections > "$BACKUP_DIR/package_list.txt"

    # Set appropriate permissions
    sudo chown -R chris:chris "$BACKUP_DIR"
    sudo chmod -R 600 "$BACKUP_DIR"

    echo "Configuration backup completed at: $BACKUP_DIR"

} > "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1

echo "Logs available at: $LOG_FILE"
```

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x /scripts/config_backup.sh
```

### System Files Backup

For system files, we'll create a separate rsync script that handles system directories efficiently:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

DATEYMD=$(date +%Y%m%d)
BACKUP_DIR="/mnt/backups/system/$DATEYMD"
LOG_DIR="/mnt/backups/logs"
LOG_FILE="$LOG_DIR/${DATEYMD}_system_backup.log"



# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

{
    # Starting script
    echo "Starting system backup at: $(date)"
    echo "Backup directory: $BACKUP_DIR"

    # The --one-file-system option prevents crossing filesystem boundaries
    # --hard-links preserves hard links
    # --acls and --xattrs preserve extended attributes
    sudo rsync -aAXv --one-file-system --hard-links \
        --exclude="/mnt/" \
        / "$BACKUP_DIR"

    # 2. System Information Files
    # Partition layout
    sudo fdisk -l > "$BACKUP_DIR/partition_layout.txt"
    # Disk UUIDs
    sudo blkid > "$BACKUP_DIR/disk_uuids.txt"

    # Set appropriate permissions
    sudo chown -R chris:chris "$BACKUP_DIR"
    sudo chmod -R 600 "$BACKUP_DIR"

    echo "System backup completed at: $BACKUP_DIR."

} > "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1

echo "Logs available at: $LOG_FILE"
```

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x /scripts/system_backup.sh
```

### Understanding the rsync Options

The rsync commands use several important options:

- `-a`: Archive mode, preserves almost everything
- `-A`: Preserve ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- `-X`: Preserve extended attributes
- `-v`: Verbose output
- `--one-file-system`: Don't cross filesystem boundaries
- `--hard-links`: Preserve hard links
- `--exclude`: Skip specified directories

### Storing your backups externally
While it's definitely beneficial to have a local copy of your backups to easily roll back changes, it isn't the most secure solution to have all of your information in one place. So, how can you go about transferring your system and configuration backups to another storage system? 

For the purpose of this guide, I'll be showing you how to use `rsync` for a remote transfer and how to flash the backup onto a `microSD`. 

#### Rsync for Remote Transfers
Rsync is specifically designed for copying and transferring files, so it offers more sophisticated file synchronization capabilities than basic tools like SCP.


```bash
rsync -avz --partial --progress --update chris@ubuntu-pi-server:/mnt/backups/system/master/ ~/Documents/raspberry_pi_server/backups/system/master
```

The flags do the following:

- `-a`: Archive mode, which preserves permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, etc.
- `-v`: Verbose output, showing what files are being transferred
- `-z`: Compress data during transfer for faster transmission
- `--partial`: Keep partially transferred files, allowing you to resume interrupted transfers
- `--progress`: Show progress during transfer
- `--update`: Skip files that are newer on the receiver (only transfer if source is newer)

#### Hardware Transfers

### **Note:**
**Everything up until this point has been tested and works-- relatively efficiently for such a simple setup. That being said, I still haven't tested the restore script, nor have I tried to setup simple cron jobs to automate and cleanup the backups.**

### Restoring from Backup

To restore your system from these backups:



### Important Notes

1. The `--delete` option during restore will remove files at the destination that don't exist in the backup. Use with caution.
2. Consider using rsync's `--dry-run` option to test backups and restores without making changes.
3. The backup includes sensitive system files. Store it securely and restrict access.
4. Consider encrypting the backup directory for additional security.
5. Test the restore process in a safe environment before using in production.

### Automating the Backup

Create a master backup script that runs both configuration and system backups:

```bash
# Create master backup script (save as master-backup.sh)
cat << 'EOF' > /mnt/backups/master-backup.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set up logging
exec 1> >(logger -s -t $(basename $0)) 2>&1

# Run configuration backup
/mnt/backup/backup-configs.sh

# Run system backup
/mnt/backup/backup-system.sh

# Remove backups older than 30 days
find /mnt/backups/configs/ -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} +
find /mnt/backups/system/ -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} +
EOF

# Make the script executable
chmod +x /mnt/backup/master-backup.sh

# Add to crontab (run daily at 2 AM)
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 2 * * * /mnt/backup/master-backup.sh") | crontab -
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check rsync error messages with `--verbose` option
2. Verify sufficient disk space with `df -h`
3. Monitor backup progress with `--progress` option
4. Check system logs: `sudo journalctl -u cron`
5. Verify file permissions and ownership
6. Test network connectivity for remote backups

Remember to regularly verify your backups by checking the log files and occasionally testing the restore process in a safe environment.

## **2. Configuring MicroSD Cards**
### **Purpose of MicroSD Cards**
- Experiment with other OS installations (e.g., NetBSD).
- Use one card as a backup Linux bootloader.
- Allocate one card for portable environments or additional storage.

### **Steps to Use MicroSD Cards**
1. **Format the Cards:**
   - Use `gparted` on Linux or similar tools to format the cards.
   - Choose `FAT32` for compatibility or `ext4` for Linux systems.
2. **Install Operating Systems:**
   - Download the desired OS images (e.g., NetBSD).
   - Flash the image to the card using `balenaEtcher` or `Raspberry Pi Imager`.
3. **Switching OS:**
   - Insert the appropriate microSD card and reboot the Raspberry Pi.
